# Predicting TSLA Stock Behavior using a Neural Network
Final Project codebase for ME396P Group 9 (The AIs of Texas)

Step 1: Download the training data

Under the Training Data branch, you can find the Reddit data (april20toapril21_redditdata.csv) and the TSLA stock price data (TSLAstockdata.csv). We have also included the Google Trends data (**file**), though we did not use it in our final version of our model. This data...

If you would like to pull data from Reddit yourself, download the searchreddit.py file. You will need to create a client ID, client secret, and user agent yourself by registering an application on Reddit. Go here for the instructions on how to do so (https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/quick_start.html) and here to register your app (https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

Step 2. Train your model
